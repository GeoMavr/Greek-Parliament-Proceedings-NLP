This repository is a assignment project during my Msc in Business Analyitcs.


We trained 3 diffrent algorithms to learn to classify a speech. The target variable is the political party of the speaker.If a party does not have enough support (in the Machine Learning sense, i.e., too few speeches), we excised it from the dataset since we did not get results for it.To gauge the efficacy of the algorithm, we reported also the results of a baseline classifier such as the scikit-learn's DummyClassifier.
